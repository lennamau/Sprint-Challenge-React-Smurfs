1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing- When initial request is issued to render a website, the server sends back most of the page's data and it is held in memory by the browser. When the other page information (links on the page are clicked) is requested, the page doesnâ€™t need to refresh. It can just display the information already in memory. This allows for faster browsing on the page.

Server-side routing - Requests are made to the server each time a link is clicked and a whole new page is rendered with only the information that is need. Only the requested information is held in the browser memory. The page is refreshed each time a new request is made and has to process through many protocols which could cause slower browsing speed. Most pages used Server-side routing so the SEO is better on these types of websites.
